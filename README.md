### Docker images
To run the application you will need two docker images (available on the [official docker site](https://hub.docker.com/u/tszczesn/)):
 ```markdown
 - medical_data_database -> containing mysql database with created schema 
 - medical_data_analyzer -> image with web application which is using previous docker image as a database 
```
To pull the images from docker repository use the commands below:
```
docker pull tszczesn/medical_data_database
docker pull tszczesn/medical_data_analyzer
```
and run both of them using the commands (NOTE: mind the order as the medical_data_database needs to be run first):
```
docker run --name=medical_data_database -d tszczesn/medical_data_database
docker run --link medical_data_database -p 8080:8080 --name=analyzer -d tszczesn/medical_data_analyzer
```
The application is available under [localhost:8080](localhost:8080) address
